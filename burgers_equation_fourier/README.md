# Spectral Methods for the Schrodinger Equation and Matrix Multiplication using MPI

## Fourier-Galerkin Spectral Method

We solve the Schrodinger Equation for a free particle with periodic boundary
conditions using the Fourier basis for the wavefunction. The equation is

> u_t = i u_xx

And we assume
